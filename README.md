# Frogdacity
## Classic arcade game built with object-oriented JavaScript.
Frogdacity is a jump and run game I've built during my [Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://de.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001/).
It is a simple version of [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

### How to start game
To play the game simply download the zip and open the index.html in your browser. 
### How to play game
The game uses keyboard input to move the player around the board, collect points and avoid enemies.
- Use the arrow keys to move: up, down, left and right.
- Reaching the water gives you 1 point.
- 5 points increases your level and speed up the enemies.
- Game Over when your character hits an enemy!

 **HAVE FUN!**
